init get has arr of random mvmt vectors
  in actual ml, array is of neuron funcs
fitness is how close it gets to goal

next gen chooses parent using rng based on prev gen fitness
each m vector has % chance of randomizing

thats it



optimizations
- best of prev gen doesnt mutate
- procedurally solve init gen and let ml optimize
